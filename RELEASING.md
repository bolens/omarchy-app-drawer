# Release playbook

[Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)

Releases use Semantic Versioning and signed annotated `vX.Y.Z` tags on `main`.

## Prepare and validate

1. Start from an up-to-date branch and choose a version appropriate to the
   compatibility impact.
2. Update the single authoritative version in `manifest.json`.
3. Move completed changes from `Unreleased` into a dated `CHANGELOG.md`
   section and update comparison links.
4. Run `OMABAR_LIVE_TESTS=never npm test`, then the live and stress validation
   from [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) on an Omarchy workstation.

## Review and publish

1. Open a pull request, require CI and review conversations to pass, then
   squash-merge it and delete the branch. Never push directly to `main` or
   bypass protection.
2. Tag the validated `main` commit as `vX.Y.Z`. The release workflow verifies
   the tag and publishes a checksummed, provenance-attested source archive.

## Verify and recover

Never move a published tag. Fix a broken release forward with a new patch
version. Verify the archive retains `manifest.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
`NOTICE`, and `preview.png` and excludes maintainer-only files.

Verify the published provenance after the workflow finishes:

```sh
gh attestation verify "omarchy-app-drawer-$version.tar.gz" \
  --repo bolens/omarchy-app-drawer
```

Confirm the checksum, archive contents, clean install/update path, Pages release
display, and marketplace listing. Preserve the tag SHA, CI run, digest, and
attestation result as release evidence.

## Source lint

The Source lint workflow checks maintained python, javascript, css files selected by
[`.github/source-lint.json`](.github/source-lint.json) on every pull request
and push to `main`. Existing native checks remain part of the merge gate.
Use the [shared local reproduction instructions](https://github.com/bolens/.github/blob/7603518f305fb76f7bb1b9979f2692521f633b82/docs/source-lint.md)
with the same tooling revision pinned in
[the workflow](.github/workflows/source-lint.yml). Review exclusions when adding
source files; generated and imported files retain their native validation.
Require the new check to pass on the current PR head before merging.

## Woodpecker plugin validation

[Woodpecker](https://woodpecker.bolens.dev/repos) runs the plugin archive,
ShellCheck, behavior and QML lint checks on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
It uses the same immutable Omarchy toolchain image and v4.0.1 imports as
GitHub CI. The entry point is `bash scripts/woodpecker-plugin.sh` inside that
image. It requires network access only to fetch the pinned public imports
and any lockfile-based test dependencies; it receives no publishing secrets.

The required plugin check is `ci/woodpecker/pr/plugin`. Ordinary GitHub PR
and main runs skip the duplicate plugin jobs. Reusable callers retain hosted
plugin validation by default; signed release validation explicitly enables
`release_validation: true` before publication. Use Woodpecker for manual plugin
validation. Repository links, HTML/XML, browser accessibility, workflow security,
compatibility canaries, macOS, development-image builds, Pages and signed release
publication retain their GitHub workflows. Native success does not replace those
checks or prove live desktop behavior. No release is created by validation CI.

Editor image changes select a real hosted Docker build and post-create smoke
under a non-root user with a read-only image and no host Docker socket. Review
native workflow image pins monthly and after security releases; Dependabot's
Dockerfile coverage does not discover `.woodpecker/` image references.
