# Contributing

[Documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md)

Keep changes focused, deterministic, and compatible with Omarchy Shell.

For behavior or architecture changes, review the relevant contract in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and update affected tests. Before opening a
pull request, run the applicable validation from [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). Use an issue first for substantial interface,
persistence, security, or compatibility changes.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bolens/omarchy-app-drawer.git
cd omarchy-app-drawer
OMABAR_LIVE_TESTS=never npm test
npm run hooks:install
```

The pre-commit hook validates the staged release payload and runs the
deterministic suite. Graphical, live IPC, and stress checks remain explicit.

Pull requests should explain the problem, chosen behavior, user-visible impact,
and exact validation performed. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and documentation for
user-facing changes. Include visual evidence for layout or animation changes.
Never include secrets, private paths, personal monitor names, or unrelated logs.
